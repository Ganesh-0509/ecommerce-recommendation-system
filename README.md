# 🛒 Ecommerce Product Recommendation System

An AI-powered recommendation system for e-commerce that uses product embeddings, cosine similarity, and intelligent agents to suggest relevant products to users.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This system is built to help e-commerce platforms recommend products to customers based on product descriptions and customer preferences.

It uses:
- **Python** for backend logic
- **Ollama AI** for generating product embeddings
- **Cosine Similarity** for finding similar products
- **SQLite** for lightweight database storage
- Modular design: Agents for customers, products, memory, and recommendations

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Ganesh-0509/ecommerce-recommendation-system.git

cd ecommerce-recommendation-system

### 2. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows

### 3. Install dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4. Ensure your database is ready

    Make sure ecommerce.db is in your project root. If needed, update the database schema manually or via setup scripts.

### 5. Generate embeddings for products

    python scripts/generate_embedding.py

### 6. Run tests and demo

    python test_script.py

### 🧠 How it works
    1.Product embeddings: Text descriptions of products are converted into vector embeddings using Ollama AI.

    2.Customer interactions: Customer queries and preferences are matched with product vectors.

    3.Similarity calculation: Using cosine similarity, the closest matching products are recommended.

    4.Test script: Run the end-to-end flow to see recommendations in action!

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
    1.Python 3.x

    2.SQLite

    3.Ollama AI

    4.Logging

    5.Cosine Similarity

    6.Modular Python architecture

### ✨ Features
    1.Automatic embedding generation for products

    2.Scalable architecture with agents (Product, Customer, Memory, Recommender)

    3.Testable system with test_script.py

    4.Lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy
